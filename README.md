# Alessandro Cavaliere - Portfolio Website

Welcome to the official repository for my personal portfolio website. This project is a digital space where I showcase my skills, experiences, and projects. 

## 🚀 Purpose

The primary goal of this portfolio is to provide a comprehensive overview of my professional journey. It serves as a platform to highlight the work I’ve done, including various projects hosted on GitHub. In this portfolio, I share the milestones that have shaped my career, such as the completion of my **Bachelor’s thesis** on **Decentralized Exchanges (DEXs)** and my pursuit of a **Master’s degree in Cybersecurity**.  

💻 Finalist at [CyberChallenge.IT](https://cyberchallenge.it/) 2024, I am passionate about computer science and innovation ⚡.  
🔐 For my Master’s Thesis, I developed during my **Erasmus+** a research framework in **Rust** exploring **Zero-Knowledge Proofs** and **Zero-Knowledge Virtual Machines** for privacy-preserving smart contract vulnerability disclosure. I also authored a research paper based on this work, which was accepted at a peer-reviewed academic conference.<br>
🚀 Always eager to embrace new challenges and technologies in the world of **Blockchain** and **Web 3.0**.

This website is self-hosted on a **Raspberry Pi 5** and deployed on a decentralized domain using the **Ethereum Name Service (ENS)**, with content stored on the **InterPlanetary File System (IPFS)**. This setup ensures resilience, privacy, and security, fully reflecting my passion for decentralized technologies.

## 🛠️ Technologies Used

   - **Frontend:** React, TypeScript, SCSS, Vite;
   - **Animations:** Framer Motion;
   - **Hosting:** Self-hosted on a Raspberry Pi 5 running a lightweight Linux stack;
   - **Decentralized Storage:** InterPlanetary File System (IPFS);
   - **Decentralized Domain:** alessandro-cavaliere.eth.limo via Ethereum Name Service (ENS).

## Experiences

### 🌟 Experiences

In the "Experiences" section of this portfolio you can see all my most important professional experiences.

- **Cyber Security Consultant - Team Cyber Threat Intelligence:** Currently working as a Cyber Threat Intelligence Consultant;
- **CyberChallenge.IT 2024:** National cybersecurity competition that I followed and faced the national competition;
- **Blockchain Developer:** 1 year as a Blockchain Developer.

## 👨‍💻 Projects

In the "Projects" section of the site, you will find detailed descriptions of some of my most important projects carried out, especially during the Master's degree period:

- **Zero-Knowledge of Exploit:** My MSc Thesis project. This project is a Rust-based toolkit for proving Ethereum smart contract exploits using Zero-Knowledge Proofs. I also wrote a scientific paper on this, peer-reviewed and accepted for the **ACM SAC 2026** conference (March 23-27, 2026); you can find the link to the paper under this project;
- **Modbus2Chain:** An IoT project integrating Modbus TCP protocol with blockchain;
- **bytethecookies-nfts:** NFT collection project for the CTF By The Cookies team of which I am actively part;
- **FVAB_EmotionGait:** A project on emotion recognition using LSTM networks;
- **PT-Vulnerable-VM:** I set up a Virtual Machine "vulnerable by design";
- **Decentralized Exchange - DEFI:** A DEX developed as part of my thesis on smart contracts and DEFI;
- **UnisaEAT:** A big project developed during the three-year degree period.

Each project is hosted on GitHub, where you can explore the code, read what I have written, and see the development history.

## 🛰️ Decentralized Hosting with ENS and IPFS

#### Why ENS?

**Ethereum Name Service (ENS)** provides a secure and decentralized way to map human-readable names like `alessandro-cavaliere.eth` to machine-readable identifiers such as Ethereum addresses or IPFS content hashes. This system ensures that my website remains accessible and resistant to censorship while reflecting my commitment to the principles of decentralization, very dear to me. My domain interacts directly with the **ENS Registry contract** at [0xD4416b13d2b3a9aBae7AcD5D6C2BbDBE25686401](https://etherscan.io/address/0xD4416b13d2b3a9aBae7AcD5D6C2BbDBE25686401), which is responsible for managing the ownership and resolution of `.eth` domains on the Ethereum network. 

#### Why IPFS?
**The InterPlanetary File System (IPFS)** is a distributed file system that allows for the storage and sharing of data across a decentralized network. Unlike traditional hosting methods, IPFS makes the website resilient to failures, as content is stored across multiple nodes, ensuring availability even if some nodes go offline. This aligns with the decentralized nature of the **blockchain** and enhances the security and permanence of my portfolio. We don't want our provider to crash. 😉

## 🧪 Current Status

This portfolio is now fully live and hosted on IPFS and ENS, embracing a decentralized architecture.
You can expect continuous updates and new features as I keep building. 🌐✨
