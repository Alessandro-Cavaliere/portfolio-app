# Alessandro Cavaliere - Portfolio Website

Welcome to the official repository for my personal portfolio website. This project is a digital space where I showcase my skills, experiences, and projects. 

## üöÄ Purpose

The primary goal of this portfolio is to provide a comprehensive overview of my professional journey. It serves as a platform to highlight the work I‚Äôve done, including various projects hosted on GitHub. In this portfolio, I share the milestones that have shaped my career, such as the completion of my **Bachelor's thesis**, which focused on decentralized exchanges (**DEX**), and the journey that led me to pursue a **Master‚Äôs degree** in Cybersecurity. One of the key achievements featured is my qualification for the **CyberChallenge.IT 2024**, a prestigious national cybersecurity competition. This competition represents a significant accomplishment in my career, reflecting my dedication and expertise in the field of cybersecurity.

This website is currently in **BETA** and will undergo further enhancements. In future versions, it will be self-hosted on a decentralized domain using the **Ethereum Name Service (ENS)** and stored on the **InterPlanetary File System (IPFS)**. This will ensure greater resilience, privacy, and security for the content, aligning with my passion for decentralized technologies.

## üõ†Ô∏è Technologies Used

   - **Frontend:** React, TypeScript, SCSS, Vite
   - **Animations:** Framer Motion
   - **Hosting:** (To be self-hosted in the future)
   - **Decentralized Storage:** (IPFS in future versions)
   - **Decentralized Domain:** (ENS **.eth domain** in future versions)

## Experiences

### üåü Experiences

In the "Experiences" section of this portfolio you can see all my most important professional experiences.

- **CyberChallenge.IT 2024:** National cybersecurity competition that I followed and faced the national competition.
- **Blockchain Developer:** 1 year as a Blockchain Developer.

## üë®‚Äçüíª Projects

In the "Projects" section of the site, you will find detailed descriptions of some of my most important projects carried out, especially during the Master's degree period:

- **Zero-Knowledge of Exploit:** My MSc Thesis project. This project is a Rust-based toolkit for proving Ethereum smart contract exploits using Zero-Knowledge Proofs.
- **Modbus2Chain:** An IoT project integrating Modbus TCP protocol with blockchain.
- **bytethecookies-nfts:** NFT collection project for the CTF By The Cookies team of which I am actively part.
- **FVAB_EmotionGait:** A project on emotion recognition using LSTM networks.
- **PT-Vulnerable-VM:** I set up a Virtual Machine "vulnerable by design".
- **Decentralized Exchange - DEFI:** A DEX developed as part of my thesis on smart contracts and DEFI.
- **UnisaEAT:** A big project developed during the three-year degree period.

Each project is hosted on GitHub, where you can explore the code, read what I have written, and see the development history.

## üõ∞Ô∏è Decentralized Hosting with ENS and IPFS

#### Why ENS?

**Ethereum Name Service (ENS)** provides a secure and decentralized way to map human-readable names like `alessandro-cavaliere.eth` to machine-readable identifiers such as Ethereum addresses or IPFS content hashes. This system ensures that my website remains accessible and resistant to censorship while reflecting my commitment to the principles of decentralization, very dear to me.

#### Why IPFS?
**The InterPlanetary File System (IPFS)** is a distributed file system that allows for the storage and sharing of data across a decentralized network. Unlike traditional hosting methods, IPFS makes the website resilient to failures, as content is stored across multiple nodes, ensuring availability even if some nodes go offline. This aligns with the decentralized nature of the **blockchain** and enhances the security and permanence of my portfolio. We don't want our provider to crash. üòâ

## üß™ Current Status

This portfolio is now fully live and hosted on IPFS and ENS, embracing a decentralized architecture.
You can expect continuous updates and new features as I keep building. üåê‚ú®
